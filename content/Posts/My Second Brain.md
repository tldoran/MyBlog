## Hello and Welcome. Welcome to my second brain, my new blog pipeline...


During the last week I have spent a lot of time cooed up at home. Myself, my laptop and some AI's.

It has helped me understand how vital of a time it is for all of us to portray what is in our minds and turn that into digestible content for ourselves. To create.

Our brains aren't made for holding onto information, if that were the case, we'd be caught up reading the same book each day, trying to hold onto futile details.

I believe that it is better to let go...

### As we near towards a time of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), we must try and understand ourselves (and the robots), to make meaningful decisions for the future and fate of humanity.

There has never been a time where we so desperately need to try and find out who we are, what we stand for what are our goals are, what is important to US.

Having a clear path in mind doesn't guarantee success, but not having one ought to guarantee failure.

I was inspired by an idol of mine: [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnE7c0ELEH8), to setup my own blog pipeline.

I did this through using: [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) as my new note taking tool, paired with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework for deploying lightweight websites. I used the terminal Hugo theme (for my fellow tech enthusiasts) !

Access my [Github files](https://github.com/tldoran/MyBlog) for this project if you'd like to create something similar !
